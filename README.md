# Advent-of-Code-2023
An elixir based attempt at Advent of Code 2023

This year I am going to use Elixir as my language of choice. My goal is to get to atleast day 10, but we will see how far we get. 

The general structure of the days is that for each day there will a .livemd notebook that will explain my thoughts and showcase the code for each part. The Files are uploaded to my instance of LiveBook, but it would be trivial to upload inputs for yourself. They aren't embedded however.

Here are some rules that I am using to guide my solutions:
1. No third party libraries or packages. The exceptions are the Elixir stdlib, Erlang stdlib, Kino, and NX. Kino for working with Livebook, and NX because without it working with matrices is an...unpleasent..experience.
2. The input file must be parsed in full, no copying and pasting part of it. This isn't because I think it's cheating if you do, it just makes the files more consistent.

Let's have fun!
